    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we attempt to build the model to predict the income of tech employees in Canada by using a multi-linear regression model based on the following features: years of coding experience, programming languages used, education level, and role. After the hyperparameter tuning process, $R^2$ of the training data set increases from 0.67 to 0.72, and the model is also tested on the testing data set with $R^2 = 0.71$, which is consistent with the training result. Besides, there are 3 points that we want to explore further in the future: to find other explanatory variables that might give us a better score, to include the United States in our model, to identify the best features that contribute to the prediction."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to allow tech employees in Canada to get a reasonable estimation of how much they will potentially earn given their skill set and years of experience. Fresh graduates and seasoned employees would benefit from an analysis tool that allows them to predict their earning potential. While the Human Resources (HR) department of companies has access to this market information, tech employees are mostly clueless about what their market value is. Therefore, a salary predictor tool could assist them in the negotiation process."

    "## Methods\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The data set used in this project is from the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey), which is conducted annually. The survey data set has nearly 80,000 responses. There are several useful features that could be extracted from this survey such as education level, location, the language used, job type, all of which are potentially associated with annual compensation {cite}`stack_overflow_survey`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "After performing EDA on the training data set,  there are several points worth mentioning. The distribution of the response variable, salary, is positively skewed with a fat tail, as shown in Fig. 1 {cite}`vanderplas2018altair`. This attribute is undesirable, which makes the model less robust. So, extremely high salaries (top 8%) in our training data set will be defined as outliers that are removed in the preprocessing step.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Among all the features investigated, it can be found that the salary is strongly correlated to the number of professional coding years. Fig.2 clearly shows that there is a linear relationship between the number of professional coding years and the salary. Figure.3 displays both effects of professional coding years and languages mastered on the salary.\n",

    "### Model\n",
    "In light of EDA and recommendations from Stack Overflow, 4 features are extracted that are duration for being a profession, education level, programming language worked with and job position. Then, the regression equation can be obtained:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",

    "*where w is the weight vector, X is the feature vector, b is the error term, $Y_{salary}$ is predicted variable.* <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the training data set, randomized hyperparameter searching was also carried out based on the scoring matrix, $R^2$."
