    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we attempt to build the model to predict the income of tech employees in Canada by using a multi-linear regression model based on the following features: years of coding experience, programming languages used, education level, and role. After the hyperparameter tuning process, $R^2$ of the training data set increases from 0.67 to 0.72, and the model is also tested on the testing data set with $R^2 = 0.71$, which is consistent with the training result. Besides, there are 3 points that we want to explore further in the future: to find other explanatory variables that might give us a better score, to include the United States in our model, to identify the best features that contribute to the prediction."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to allow tech employees in Canada to get a reasonable estimation of how much they will potentially earn given their skill set and years of experience. Fresh graduates and seasoned employees would benefit from an analysis tool that allows them to predict their earning potential. While the Human Resources (HR) department of companies has access to this market information, tech employees are mostly clueless about what their market value is. Therefore, a salary predictor tool could assist them in the negotiation process."

    "### Methods\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "The data set used in this project is from the [Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey), which is conducted annually. The survey data set has nearly 80,000 responses. There are several useful features that could be extracted from this survey such as education level, location, the language used, job type, all of which are potentially associated with annual compensation {cite:p}`stack_overflow_survey`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "After performing EDA on the training data set,  there are several points worth mentioning. The distribution of the response variable, salary, is positively skewed with a fat tail, as shown in Fig. 1 {cite:p}`vanderplas2018altair`. This attribute is undesirable, which makes the model less robust. So, extremely high salaries (top 8%) in our training data set will be defined as outliers that are removed in the preprocessing step.<br>\n",

    "Density plot of annual compensation(USD): The distribution of annual compensation is right skewed with extremely large value as well as extremely small value.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all the features investigated, it can be found that the salary is strongly correlated to the number of professional coding years. Fig.2 clearly shows that there is a linear relationship between the number of professional coding years and the salary. Figure.3 displays both effects of professional coding years and languages mastered on the salary.\n",

    "#### Model\n",
    "In light of EDA and recommendations from Stack Overflow, 4 features are extracted that are duration for being a profession, education level, programming language worked with and job position. Then, the regression equation can be obtained:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "    y_{salary} = w^T X + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*where w is the weight vector, X is the feature vector, b is the error term, $y_{salary}$ is predicted variable.* <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge model is chosen in this case, which can help reduce over-fitting problems. Ridge solves a regression model where the loss function is the linear least squares function and regularization is given by the L2-norm. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    loss\\ function = ||y - w^T X||^2_2 + alpha * ||w||^2_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*where alpha is regularization strength to reduces the variance of the estimates. Larger values specify stronger regularization.* <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the training data set, randomized hyperparameter searching was carried out based on the scoring matrix, $R^2$. Then, the model with the best performed parameter was used to make prediction on the test data set."

We tested the final model on our test data (20% of the survey data) and the model performed well on the test data with an accuracy of 71%. As you can see in Fig 8, the model is slightly under predicting or over-predicting, but the fit seems to be good. This is a decent score that indicates that our model generalizes enough and should perform well on unseen examples.\n",

In order to identify the best features that contribute to the prediction, we will include all the sensible columns in the original survey, and perform model and feature selection. We hope that this will help us discover more features that are important for the annual compensation prediction of tech employees."
